        "content": "Hi and welcome to the SportsBetGrowth website. This is the first blog post for the site. I started this site because I always wanted a website and wanted to build something myself that I could point and say here is some work I\u2019ve actually done entirely on my own. It started out a relatively simple and probably naive thought, \"I\u2019ll create a static webpage and go from there\". Once you get into the business of actually building a website things become a lot more complicated than you expect. \n\nI started with exploring sites like wix.com, Wordpress, Squarespace and even a new one called dorik.com. My experience with those all in one website builders wasn\u2019t great, I felt like there was a steep enough learning curve to be able to use their products and so decided to dive in and try to do the actual coding myself. I also felt like there just wasn't the scope for being able to build the product the way you like but maybe I just didn't stick with them for long enough.To help me build this site I used ChatGPT as a coding co-pilot. I hope you like it and if you do or you don\u2019t please use the contact us form and tell us what you think. \n\nThis post was originally designed to lay out what the plan would be for the weeks and months ahead to try and give some detail on that I am committed to sticking with the site and trying to grow it from 0 users today to some number in the future I can be proud of. I have decided not to define that number because I think actual number based goals in that fashion can be a bit demoralising when you\u2019re shooting for something quite difficult. It\u2019s like starting running from 0, I didn\u2019t ever think I\u2019d be trying to run marathons someday and if I started out with that as my day one goal I\u2019d say I have quit. One site that I\u2019ve checked out that is quite similar or that is something I\u2019d aspire to has 12,000 users per month which I think is quite impressive. If I could get anywhere near that in the next 12 to 24 months that would be incredible. \n\nOne thought I had was that starting on a journey of trying to build something out of nothing in the digital world is quite scary. I think staying off social media and trying not to let it impact you in terms of what people are saying is good advice. That\u2019s quite an easy thing to say but everything you read says you need to use social media to help generate traffic so a bit of a double entendre there in my opinion. What I will also say about trying to build a site and with it a user base is that you learn a lot trying to embark on the journey. There are so many things I have so much respect for now. Some skills you really need when trying to build a site include:\u2028 \nKnowledge of User Experience and Design - I don\u2019t know if this is the most important thing but it\u2019s certainly one area I\u2019ve found myself sorely lacking in. There are so many things to think about that's hard to explain how difficult it is to not make a complete mess of what was previously a nice white space.\n\nRespect for Website Architecture - This one very quickly became a nightmare for me. As you move through creating what you think is a cool little page you soon realise you're hard coding everything into your code and so changes become pretty difficult.The importance of the structure and architecture and planning of the site became clear when I really got stuck into building out the blog.html page. Once you're into building your own CMS to serve your blogs things become much more challenging.\n\nUnderstanding of the limitations of ChatGPT - GPT is great please do not get me wrong and I'm very grateful to have it as a tool but from my experience there are real challenges if you're coming from 0 and asking it to try and help you build a website. It easily forgets things and as the site builds up it can lead you down some seriously challenging paths. The site wouldn't have been possible without GPT but I will say that I don't think we're in the place where AI replaces everything for a while. There are limitations to what it can do, I know that is mis-aligned to the common narrative from the wider online community but in my opinion it's true. To close this point off I'll highlight something interesting that I asked GPT and Gemini when I was quite deep into the project. The question was \"Could I write enough code with you to start an online casino?\" The answers I got back were wilding different. \n\nGPT: \"Yes, you could absolutely write enough code to start an online casino with my assistance...\"\nGemini: \"No, you can't write enough code with me to start an online casino...\"\n\nPretty interesting answers in both cases and maybe one is better than the other for reasons that you wouldn't expect. You could potentially waste a lot of time messing around trying to pull that off with GPT whereas the Gemini answer is the one that's truthful... Food for thought in the whole world of thinking that \"Open AI has won the AI battle\" narrative.\n\nI said I would use this post to lay out what to expect in the coming days and weeks and that is what I'll attempt to do to wrap up. What you can expect is that I'll keep building the site and improving the UX, I think that's the most important thing, let's called it priority 1A \"Have an awesome experience that people like using\". Then I'll try and produce content people like, priority 1B and then I'll start experimenting with features to try and keep people interested and coming back, priority 1C. The newsletter sign up is open and I'll use that to send out a weekly update of how the project is going and to also promote the blog posts I write. If you haven't already I'd be hugely grateful if you signed up to our newsletter. We won't spam you and will only email once a week. All the best and thanks for taking the time to read this first SBG blog post. ",
